# India EV Charger Market 2024-2030: Market, Size and Growth



Indian electric vehicle market is changing rapidly with factors ranging from government push for clean mobility, increasing consciousness of climatic issues, and increasing fossil fuel prices. With increasing sales of EVs, the demand for electric vehicle chargers is also seeing an increasing trend. India has a significant role to play in the mass adoption of electric vehicles. The development of the EV charger market is critical for India's green transition.

# vMarket Overview
Indian EV Charger Market manufactures, distributes, and deploys various kinds of chargers suitable for different segments of the electric vehicle ecosystem. India has a market that is upward moving, driven by two- and three-wheeler and passenger car and commercial vehicles segment growth in terms of EV sales. The Indian market for chargers still is at its nascent stage in 2023 but likely to experience exponential growth, supported by government incentives, investments from private companies, and increased awareness among the consumers.

The key drivers for this market include ambitious targets set by the Indian government regarding achieving 30% electric vehicle adoption by 2030 and the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme. This framework has given both the EV industry and the EV charging infrastructure a much-needed impetus.

Types of EV Chargers
The market of EV chargers categorizes into the kind of charger and charging speed. A few of the most common types of EV chargers found in India are:-

AC Chargers (Slow Charging):

Level 1 chargers employ single-phase power and release charging through a general household socket, delivering 2-5 kW of power. Such chargers can be easily spotted in residential applications.
Level 2 chargers deliver 7-22 kW of power and can be used in home, public, and workplace settings. Generally, these types of chargers usually charge a regular EV in approximately 4-6 hours.
DC Fast Chargers, otherwise known as Rapid Charging:
Level 3 chargers, or DC fast chargers, provide power from 50 kW to 350 kW and offer the ability to recharge to up to 80% for an EV battery in only 30 minutes. Most often located at public charging stations, highway rest stops, and fleet charging depots, this type of charger is beneficial for long-distance travel.
While ultra-fast chargers with more than 350 kW of power output are still in nascent stages of penetration in India, they are basically aimed at long-distance EVs and commercial electric trucks.
Market Segments
Indian EV Charger market can be split into the following categories based on the kind of vehicle that is going to be charged:
Two-Wheelers and Three-Wheelers:
These vehicles comprise a large percentage of the Indian EV market. Electric scooters, motorcycles, and e-rickshaws are progressively becoming more popular, while, at the same time, there is steadily increasing demand for simple, low-cost charging solutions, mainly in the form of AC chargers.

Passenger Cars
The Indian electric car market is slowly widening up with sales of models such as Tata Nexon EV and MG ZS EV. Public and residential charging infrastructure for passenger cars is an important growth area for Level 2 chargers and DC fast chargers.

Commercial Vehicles
Electric buses, trucks, and fleet vehicles are gaining popularity, especially in the urban transport network. This sector also requires high capacity fast charging at depots and inter-city charging stations.

Key Market Drivers Several factors are adding growth to the EV charger market in India:

# Government Initiatives and Policies:
Under the FAME II scheme, installation of charging infrastructure gets subsidised. Public and private charging stations have been springing up across the country on account of this. In addition, NEMMP 2020 and the PLI schemes concentrate on local manufacturing of component parts of EVs, including chargers.

Increased Adoption of EVs
With an ever-increasing number of customers transitioning to electric cars, the availability of a widely spread and accessible charging network is urgently needed. The EV charger market will be in direct proportion to the growth of the EV market, and as more EVs start hitting the road, the demand for reliable charging infrastructure increases.

Private Investments
Several Indian companies, including Tata Power, Hero Electric, and Ola Electric, and international players like ABB and Delta Electronics, are hugely investing in building the EV charging network. Other prominent players entering the market include startups and tech companies with innovative solutions in charging, including mobile and on-demand charging services.

Urbanization and Environmental Concerns:
The rapidly urbanized population of India, coupled with the alarming increase in air pollution in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru adds an element of urgency to the demand for cleaner mobility through pure electric solutions. As a result, it requires scalable and convenient charging infrastructure.

Growth Restraints for India's EV Charger Market
Despite all this optimism, the Indian EV Charger market has to face several challenges, as discussed below:

High Initial Costs:
The installation of charging infrastructure is expensive, mainly for the case of DC fast chargers. For the majority of customers contemplating buying EVs, unavailability of affordable, widely accessible charging stations deters them.

# Grid Capacity and Reliability:

India has to have its grid structure mainly in semi-urban and rural areas upgraded to handle the potential large scale of charging EVs. Unreliable power supply at some areas has been a constraint to ensure a seamless experience while charging.
The biggest bottleneck has always been the problem of identifying high-density locations in urban space to establish the infrastructure for public charging. In addition to the challenge of actually deploying a robust charging network through adequate parking facilities, real estate costs pose an added difficulty.

Standardization:
The lack of harmony in standards for connectors and protocols for charging again poses a problem for users and manufacturers alike. Efforts are streamlined in this direction, but fragmentation is a challenge left still.

# Key Players in the Market
A few key players, however, are shaping the EV charger landscape in India:

Tata Power:
One of the largest energy companies in India, Tata Power, has made massive investments in EV charging infrastructure with an aim to install over 25,000 EV charging stations by 2025.

Fortum India:
This is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Finnish clean energy company Fortum India, which has been actively installing fast-charging stations in partnership with leading automakers such as Tata Motors.

ABB India:
ABB is a leader in electrification technologies with the ability to tackle some of the world's largest challenges with its solution for electric vehicle charging. The company has worked with several Indian partners to expand its fast-charging installations across major cities in India.

Delta Electronics:
Delta is a global leader in power and energy management solutions and offers a range of options to charge Electric Vehicles, which comprise AC as well as DC fast charging solutions.

Magenta Power:
Magenta Power is a start-up based in Mumbai with the goal of providing clean energy options and deploying public and home-based EV charging stations.

# Future Trends
The prospects for India's EV charger market are quite optimistic. The Indian government envisages that at least one charging station would be established in the cities at an interval of every three kilometers by 2030, and on highways at every 25 kilometers. Further boosting its fortunes, the market is to be driven by future smart charging solutions, mobile applications for seeking charging stations, and integration of renewable energy into the charging infrastructure.

These factors coupled with advancements in battery technology and the use of vehicle-to-grid solutions will characterize the future of charging EVs in the country. Both public and private sectors seem ready to fly high on the venture of the EV charger market in India, which is expected to take off in a big way in the near future.
